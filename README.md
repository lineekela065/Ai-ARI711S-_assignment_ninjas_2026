## Question 1 — Warehouse Logistics Robot (Search Algorithms)

**Algorithms implemented:**
- Greedy Best-First Search — priority based on `h(n)` (Euclidean distance to goal)
- A\* Search — priority based on `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`

**Key components:**
- `Node` class — stores state, parent, action, and path cost `g(n)`
- `Warehouse` class — parses `.txt` layout, locates A/B, stores walls, finds neighbours
- `solve(algorithm)` — priority queue search with cycle prevention
- Visual output: `warehouse_path.png` with colour-coded path, explored cells, and walls

**To run:**
1. Place your `warehouse.txt` file in the `question1/` directory
2. Open and run `question1_warehouse_search.ipynb`

## Question 2 — Telecommunication Tower Placement (CSP)

**Problem:** Place 8 signal boosters on a 10×10 grid satisfying:
- No two towers in the same row or column
- No two towers in adjacent cells (including diagonals)
- No towers on mountain (prohibited) cells

**Key components:**
- `Telecom_CSP_Solver` class with backtracking search
- MRV heuristic — selects the most constrained unassigned variable
- Forward Checking — prunes domains after each placement
- `is_consistent()` — validates all constraints before placement

**Test Levels:**
| Level | Name | Mountains |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Coastal (Easy) | 3 scattered cells |
| 2 | Highlands (Medium) | 7 cells in clusters |
| 3 | Brandberg (Hard) | 10 cells forming an L-wall |

## Question 3 — Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax (Adversarial Search)

**Algorithm:** Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

**Functions implemented:**
- `player(board)` — returns whose turn it is (X or O)
- `actions(board)` — returns all valid moves
- `result(board, action)` — returns new board without modifying original
- `winner(board)` — checks all 8 winning lines
- `terminal(board)` — detects end of game
- `utility(board)` — scores terminal states (+1, −1, 0)
- `minimax(board)` — returns the optimal move

The AI is **unbeatable** — it always wins or draws, never loses.
